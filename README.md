# Potential Overflow in VHDL Adder Process

This repository demonstrates a potential overflow issue in a simple VHDL adder process. The original code lacks proper overflow handling, leading to unexpected behavior when the input reaches its maximum value.

The solution implements a robust overflow check to mitigate the issue.

## Bug Description

The VHDL code implements a simple process that adds 1 to the input vector 'a' and outputs the result to 'b'.  However, if 'a' is already at its maximum value (255 for an 8-bit vector), the addition will result in an overflow, potentially causing unexpected outputs or simulation errors.

## Solution

The improved code adds a check to prevent the overflow. If 'a' is 255, the output 'b' remains at 255, preventing the overflow.
